                <p>Virat Kohli, born on November 5, 1988, in Delhi, India, is one of the most celebrated cricketers in
                    contemporary cricket. He is a right-handed batsman and occasional right-arm off spin bowler, who
                    currently captains the Indian team in Test cricket and is its vice-captain in limited overs formats.
                    In
                    the Indian Premier League (IPL), he captains the Royal Challengers Bangalore.After representing
                    Delhi at
                    various age-group levels and domestic cricket, Kohli captained India Under-19s to victory at the
                    2008
                    Under-19 World Cup in Malaysia. A few months later, he made his ODI debut for India against Sri
                    Lanka at
                    the age of 19 years in August 2008. Initially having played as a reserve batsman in the Indian team,
                    he
                    soon established himself as a regular in the middle-order in ODIs. He was part of the Indian squad
                    that
                    won the 2011 World Cup. Kohli played his first Test in 2011 against the West Indies at Kingston. By
                    2013, he shrugged off the tag of "ODI specialist" with Test hundreds in Australia and South Africa.
                    The
                    same year, he also reached the number one spot in the ICC rankings for ODI batsmen for the first
                    time.
                    He has also found success in the Twenty20 format, winning the Man of the Tournament at the 2014 ICC
                    World Twenty20 in Bangladesh and the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 in India. In 2014, he became the
                    top-ranked
                    T20I batsman in the ICC rankings and, as of April 2016, holds the position.

                <p>Kohli was appointed the vice-captain of the ODI team in 2012 and has since also captained the team on
                    several occasions in the absence of regular skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni. After Dhoni's Test
                    retirement
                    in 2014, Kohli was handed over the Test captaincy. Kohli holds numerous Indian batting records
                    including
                    the fastest ODI century, the fastest batsman to 5,000 ODI runs and the fastest to 10 ODI centuries.
                    He
                    is only the second batsman in the world to have scored 1,000 or more ODI runs for four consecutive
                    calendar years. Kohli is the fastest batsman in the world to 1,000 runs in T20Is and also holds the
                    record for most fifties (16) in T20Is. He holds the records of most runs in a single tournament of
                    both
                    the ICC World Twenty20 and the IPL.</p>

                <p>Virat Kohli has been one of the greatest batters to play in IPL history. He has not only been
                    consistent
                    over the years but also created milestones that might arguably not be broken. Kohli is the highest
                    run-getter in IPL history, amassing 7263 runs across 237 matches and he also holds the record for
                    scoring the most runs in an IPL season (973 runs in IPL 2016).</p>
